			<h3>Latest update: July 31, 2020</h3>
			<p>Hi there,</p>
			<p>Wuwana cares about privacy, and we do our best to defend your privacy. That is why we only collect and use data that you have chosen to provide.</p>

			<h2>Your data explained as visitor</h2>
			<p>As a visitor, Wuwana collects zero personally identifiable data about you. This includes our analytics, where we only store non-personal data.</p>
			<p>We track what company pages you visit. But, in our database, there is no field that stores any form of user ID that could be used to track you specifically. This information is hidden to us.
			</p>
			<p>In simple terms, there is no way for us to know that you visited a company page. We only know that someone did.</p>
			<p>So, as a visitor, Wuwana stores zero data about you.</p>
