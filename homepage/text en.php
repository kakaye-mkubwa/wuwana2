<p>Competing with large companies is impossible for micro-roasters. In front of agencies and marketing experts, independent businesses focus on offering the best possible product.</p>
<p>Being part of platforms like Amazon Business is complicated and expensive, with exorbitant conditions and tedious processes. Thus, with the monopoly of the presence in search engines such as Google and the difficulty of accessing online sales platforms fairly, small businesses are excluded from this digital revolution.</p>
<p>At Wuwana we want to change it.</p>
<p>We are creating a modern, digital directory that supports small coffee shops and local roasters. An honest and transparent page where you will be able to filter local businesses by category, visit their web pages to get to know them better and contact them directly. We worked with a group of coffee shops and micro-roasters in Madrid in the creation of this project.</p>
<p>Support independent coffee businesses. Follow us on Twitter to be among the first to test our beta at the end of October 2020.</p>",
